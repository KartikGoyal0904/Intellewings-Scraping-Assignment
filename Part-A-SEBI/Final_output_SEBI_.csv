In view of this, as March 17, 2005 is the date of sale then to meet pay-in 
obligation it is expected that Noticee has to make delivery of shares on 
same date of sale or latest by March 18, 2005 in pool account of the broker 
through her depository participant (DP) and accordingly it is expected that 
Noticee shall issue Delivery Instruction Slip (DIS) to her Depository

2005 and date of execution of DIS by Depository Participant is March 21,

Noticee had entered into off market transactions with the same broker for 
purchase of same quantity of shares of KCL i.e. 20,000. In view of the

purchase of same quantity of shares of KCL i.e. 20,000. In view of the 
same, I do not have any hesitation to draw the inference that on March 17, 
2005 the Noticee was not having shares of KCL with her Depository 
Participant and for meeting the market obligations of delivery of shares the 
Noticee got the same quantity of shares through off market on March 18, 
2005.

2005 is clear evidence that DIS is issued two days subsequent to said 
transaction whereas according to pay in obligation, Noticee ought to have 
issued DIS either on March 17, 2005 or March 18, 2005 and Depository 
Participant would have executed the said transaction either on March 17, 
2005 or March 18, 2005 in accordance with the receipt of DIS from the 
Noticee. However, as per the records the DP had executed DIS on March 
21, 2005. Even assuming that DIS issued by the Noticee was in tandem "

securities worth Rs.148 crores and had built up short positions of Rs. 333 
corers in NIFTY Futures. ML were found to have dealt through SEBI 
registered stock broker DSP Merill Lynch Limited, (hereinafter referred to as 
the noticee).  Consequently on May 27, 2004 SEBI sought information from 
ML in relation to the trades conducted on the said days. On September 10, 
2004 SEBI called for information from the noticee in relation to the trades

were therefore not even in existence and could not be furnished to SEBI 
on October 8, 2004. 
b. At the time of inspection it was explained to SEBI that the Interoffice 
Memorandum on “Tape Listening Procedures” maintained by DSP Merill 
Lynch Ltd. requires that recorded tapes be maintained for a period of one 
month for all investment banking activity and mergers and acquisition 
activity and for a period of two weeks for all other matters, from the date of

the conversation and SEBI was given a copy of the policy for its record. 
Since by the time requests for furnishing the Telephonic Records was 
received, it was already much over the two weeks period from the date of 
making the Telephonic Records, it was impossible for DSP Merill Lynch 
Ltd. to furnish the same on that date i.e. September 10, 2004. On

Telephonic Records sought by SEBI and that too much prior to the first 
instance when the noticee was approached by SEBI, i.e September 10, 
2004.  
d. It may be noted that the DSP Merill Lynch Ltd policy is an internal 
requirement of the noticee which is consonant with the global policy of 
Merrill Lynch in relation to retention of telephonic records. The policy is not 
a result of a legal mandate that directs the noticee to maintain telephonic

with its own policies.  
f. In the absence of any legal obligation for the noticee to: a) record 
telephone conversation; b) retain such recordings for a specific period, 
DSP Merill Lynch Ltd cannot be held liable for not possessing the 
Telephonic Records. 
 
6. The noticee has also cited judgments of Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal

the Inter Office policy was circulated to all employees of the noticee on 
January 29, 2004 via email. The email dated January 29, 2009 specifically 
recorded that the attached Inter Office Policy was reviewed and amended 
by the Executive Committee of DSP Merill Lynch Ltd. and was effective 
with immediate effect. Prior to January 29, 2004, the Inter Office Policy on 
April 07, 2003 was applicable to all employees of DSP Merill Lynch Ltd.

The noticee also submitted that pursuant to the aforesaid internal policy, 
the system would automatically erase telephonic records every 15 days 
unless a request is received for retaining a particular conversation.

19. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence made 
available on record, the violation of Regulation 26(ii) of SEBI (Stock Brokers 
and Sub Brokers) Regulations 1992 is not established and therefore no 
penalty is warranted against the Stock Broker DSP Merill Lynch Ltd. under 
Section 15A of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulation 25(i) of SEBI (Stock 
Brokers and Sub Brokers) Regulations 1992 in the present adjudication 
proceedings and accordingly the present adjudication proceedings are

This pattern of trading can not be termed as mere co-incidence, it clearly signifies 
to some kind of pre-arrangement between the brokers before trading in the scrip. 
In the instant matter it is apparent that the son of the noticee was the client and

for the purpose of generating artificial volumes in the scrip of Karuna which was 
not very actively traded. There was no genuine sale or purchase, no actual transfer

that this was done to create an illusion in the mind of public that the scrip is

The argument of noticee that the matching of trades are not uncommon and if they

with the issue it is important to consider the method and the manner in which the 
trades were executed in the present matter. The motive for these transactions,

The Hon’ble SAT, in Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. Ltd. Vs SEBI (Appeal no.54-

“BEB has been charged for synchronized deals with First Global. I 
have examined the data provided by the parties on this issue.  I find

any entities controlled by the client is simultaneously entering any 
contra order elsewhere for the reason that in the online trading 
system, confidentiality of counter parties is ensured, is untenable. 
It was submitted by the Appellants that it was not possible for the 
broker to know who the counter party broker is and that trades 
were not synchronized but it was only a coincidence in some cases. 
Theoretically this is OK. But when parties decide to synchronize 
---
It may be stated that the synchronized trades/ cross deals/ circular trades are the 
instruments/ tools employed by some unscrupulous elements in the securities 
market to manipulate the market and deceive the general/ genuine investors in the 
market place. The pattern of trading, behaviour of the entities, apparent 
irregularities and the available trading data, etc., prove manipulation which 
always depends on inferences drawn on factual details. When all of these are 
considered together, they can emerge as ingredients to prove the manipulative

way.

Thus, I find that the noticee by its acts has created false or misleading appearance 
of trading in the shares of Karuna along with the other brokers and clients, which 
were responsible for the market manipulation in the price of the scrip and thus

revealed from the record that DIS was issued by Noticee on March 19, 
2005 and date of execution of DIS by Depository Participant is March 19, 
2005. Further, it appears from the record that on March 18, 2005 the 
Noticee had entered into off market transactions with the same broker for 
purchase of same quantity of shares of KCL i.e. 20,000. In view of the

purchase of same quantity of shares of KCL i.e. 20,000. In view of the 
same, I do not have any hesitation to draw the inference that on March 17, 
2005 the Noticee was not having shares of KCL with her Depository 
Participant and for meeting the market obligations of delivery of shares the 
Noticee got the same quantity of shares through off market on March 18, 
2005.  
 
---
To support my inference, the date of issuance of DIS i.e. March 19, 2005 is 
clear evidence that DIS is issued two days subsequent to said transaction 
whereas according to pay in obligation Noticee, ought to have issued DIS 
either on March 17, 2005 or March 18, 2005 and Depository Participant 
would have executed the said transaction either on March 17, 2005 or 
March 18, 2005 in accordance with the receipt of DIS from the Noticee. 
However, as per the records the DP had executed DIS on March 19, 2005. "

(PAN. ABAPK3238P) 
FACTS OF THE CASE IN BRIEF 
1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (hereinafter referred to as 
“SEBI”) conducted investigation in respect of buying, selling and dealing 
---
of SBEC in such a manner that led to creation of artificial volumes in the 
scrip and distorted market equilibrium leading to spurt in the price of the 
scrip which did not have any correlation with the performance of the 
company.  
 
3. It was alleged that the Noticee,  a sub broker of JSEL, by trading for 
himself violated the provisions of Regulations 3, 4(1), 4(2)(a), (b), (g), and 
---
examination of data and documents available on record, it was found that 
the trades executed between the clients and Noticee were reversed within 
seconds/minutes of its execution. It seems that the Noticee and his clients 
created artificial volume in the shares of the company by such a pattern of 
trading. Further, it is to be noticed that the trading pattern (as depicted in 
Table I) of the Noticee was not limited to a few occasions, but was of 
repetitive nature. The noticee had traded to an extent of 3,94,440 shares 
---
The Noticee has himself stated that he is a small, retail investor, but the 
trading pattern is quite unnatural for a retail investor. The Noticee cannot 
even take a plea of acting as Jobber. In fact, the reversal of trades in such 
short span is not a normal trading pattern at all. Further, I fail to 
understand that how a sub-broker can trade in a scrip and make losses 
everyday and still continue to trade in that particular scrip.  
 
---
the appellant had come to a standstill, we feel these high penalties will be 
merely paper orders, which can never be implemented by execution in a 
court. 
14.       It is not disputed that the company is in doldrums and has incurred 
heavy losses and is a rural company with tribal background and a perusal 
of the latest balance sheet indicates there is no liquidity and the company 
is facing the threat of winding up.

Pursuant to the investigation conducted by Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (hereinafter referred to as “SEBI”) in respect of buying, 
selling and dealing in the shares of Motorol Speciality Oils Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as ‘MSOL/Company’) for the period from January 
1, 2001 to October 5, 2001 (hereinafter referred to as “investigation

February 24, 2009 was not categorical enough to confirm the said

On perusal of regulation 13 (3) of PIT, I find that the same is attracted only 
when an entity holds/held 5% or more shares/voting rights of a company 
at any point of time. On careful examination of the facts of the case, I find 
that the Noticee had never crossed 5% of shares/voting rights of MSOL at 
any point of time and hence, she had not attracted regulations 13(3) and "

sub-broker, certain entities transacted in the shares of SBEC in such a 
manner that led to creation of artificial volumes in the scrip and distorted 
market equilibrium leading to spurt in the price of the scrip which did not 
have any correlation with the performance of the company.  
 
3. It was alleged that one of the entities, viz., Shri Sunil Kumar Bhageria 
(hereinafter referred to as “Noticee”), client of JSEL through sub broker 
---
examination of data and documents available on record, it was found that 
the trades executed between the clients and SKK were reversed within 
seconds/minutes of its execution. It seems SKK and his clients created 
artificial volume in the shares of the company by such a pattern of trading. 
Further, it is to be noticed that the trading pattern (as depicted in Table I) 
was peculiar in nature as the trading of the Noticee was restricted to only 
with SKK. The reversal of the transactions was executed at a substantial 
---
pattern of trading cannot be justified by any reasoning. The Noticee has 
himself stated that he is a small, retail investor, but the trading pattern is 
quite unnatural for a retail investor. The Noticee cannot even take a plea 
of acting as Jobber. In fact, the reversal of trades in such short span is not 
a normal trading pattern at all. Further, I fail to understand that how a 
small investor can trade in a scrip in such a manner and can attribute this 
as normal course of trading.  "

Accordingly, a notice to show cause dated August 10, 2007 under Rule 4 
of the Adjudication Rules was issued to M/s. Baij Krishna & Co.

why an enquiry should not be held against him in terms of Section 15I of

The proprietor of the Noticee, in respect of the said allegations, has made 
the following submissions vide his letter dated August 27, 2007 and also in 
course of the said personal hearing. 
¾ That during the alleged period, Baij Krishna & Co., a proprietor firm 
and Ms. Premlata Nathany had respectively purchased 19,000 and 
36,100 shares of TCL on different dates. The said purchases were 
made from the open market as a strategic investment and for long term

36,100 shares of TCL on different dates. The said purchases were 
made from the open market as a strategic investment and for long term 
holding without any malafide intention to manipulate the price. The said 
investments are still held by Baij Krishna & Co. and Ms. Premlata 
Nathany in their books. As such, the transactions are genuine in nature 
and not to create any false or misleading appearance of trading. 
¾ The said parties herein have only purchased the shares and not traded 
---
¾ As on date, because of the said holding the parties herein are suffering 
huge losses. 
¾ During the alleged period, the price of the scrip was raised to a great 
extent whereas M/s. Baij Krishna & Co. and Ms. Premlata Nathany 
made the purchases at different level. The said trading of the shares 
can not be construed as a reason for increase in the price of the 
shares. 
---
mentioned in the bank account statement of Shri Ramkrishna 
Dudwawala’s current account (No. 000605003264, ICICI Bank) that he 
had transferred by cheques Rs.7,00,000/- and Rs.11,95,000/- to the 
account of the Noticee (i.e. M/s. Baij Krishna & Co., A/c. No. CA 2901, 
United Bank of India, CSE, Calcutta) on May 24, 2004 and June 04, 2004 
respectively. From the entries mentioned in statement of the said account 
of the Noticee, it is observed that on June 05, 2004 an amount of

designed and implemented by the proprietor of the Noticee, Shri 
Ramkrishna Dudwawala, in the abovementioned fashion. It appears to me 
that Shri Ramkrishna Dudwawala, in the name of his sole proprietary firm 
M/s. Baij Krishna & Co., along with his mother Ms. Premlata Nathany, had 
executed transactions in the scrip of TCL which were not genuine and 
which merely created artificial volume and price rise in the scrip. I have 
examined the submissions of the proprietor of the Noticee stated earlier. "

the investigations do not find a nexus between the noticee and the counter party

It has been noted that the broker in its reply has submitted that it was working on 
the instructions from its client in the subject scrip. As per the submissions of 
noticee, the connection between noticee and its clients was that of only broker and 
client. No apparent nexus between the counter party clients and the noticee is 
visible from the present facts of the case.

Considering the above factors and the submissions of the noticee, and on the basis 
of the evidence available on record it cannot be concluded that the noticee acted 
in a fraudulent manner and created artificial and misleading appearance of trading

Upon consideration undersigned decided that an inquiry should be held in the 
matter and a notice of inquiry dated March 28, 2007 was therefore issued to 
noticee under Rule 4(3) of Adjudication Rules, fixing the date of personal hearing 
on April 17, 2007. On the date fixed noticee appeared through its representative 
before the undersigned for inquiry and reiterated the submissions made vide its 
earlier letter. During the personal hearing the noticee sought some time to file 
additional details and the same was filed by noticee vide its letter dated May 03,

In reply to this, noticee has denied the allegations and submitted that it had not 
indulged itself in any act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading 
in securities market.  Noticee has denied that it had acted together with any other 
counterparty broker. Noticee has submitted that the transactions entered by it were 
jobbing trades aimed at exploiting the price differential during a very short

such transactions un-doubtly create artificial market to mislead the genuine 
investors. Synchronized trading is violative of all the prudential and transparent 
norms of trading in the securities. Synchronized trading on a large scale can create 
false volumes, as happened in the instant case.

It is worth considering the fact that in the relevant period of time noticee had

4.11 
The argument of noticee that in screen based trading the identity of the 
counterparty broker is not known at the time of the order input as the trading 
system is anonymous, do not appear to be a good defence as in the present 
circumstances, the pattern of trading clearly points out that the transactions were 
carried out with the sole intention that the orders of particular clients and brokers 
match with each other. Such perfect matching of trades again and again over a

Thus, I find that the noticee by its acts has created false or misleading appearance

The investigation found that at various instances, the buy and sell order quantities 
and rates were similar and time difference between the buy and sell order entered 
was negligible (mostly less than 10 seconds). The orders of most of these trades 
appeared to be structured or synchronized. The investigations revealed that the 
orders were punched in with preconceived motive that the orders shall be picked

up by a particular client on the opposite side, which also indicates that there was 
some kind of a prior arrangement with respect to these brokers and clients to 
execute such transactions. Further these entities were also found putting orders at 
lower prices and due to this the rise in price of the scrip was gradual and appeared 
to be planned to avoid attention of regulatory authorities. Thus, the increase in the 
volumes in the scrip can be attributed to the trades done by these brokers and 
clients.

Appointment of Adjudicating Officer 
2.1 
Pursuant to the investigation into the scrip of Karuna, SEBI appointed the 
undersigned as Adjudicating Officer under Rule 3 of SEBI (Procedure For 
Holding Inquiry And Imposing Penalties By Adjudicating Officer) Rules, 1995 
(hereinafter referred to as “Adjudication Rules” or “said rules”) read with Section 
---
(1), (2) (a), (b), (e), (g) and (n) of SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair 
Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003 (hereinafter 
referred to as 'PFUTP Regulations') for which penalty is imposable under Section 
15HA and Section 15 HB of SEBI Act, 1992. The aforesaid appointment was 
conveyed vide order dated June 20, 2006.  
 

---
Upon consideration undersigned decided that an inquiry should be held in the 
matter and a notice of inquiry dated March 28, 2007 was therefore issued to 
noticee under Rule 4(3) of Adjudication Rules, fixing the date of personal hearing 
on April 17, 2007. On the date fixed noticee appeared through its proprietor and 
also through its representative before the undersigned for inquiry and placed 
reliance on the submissions made vide letter dated March 12, 2007 along with 
some other submissions. The noticee also sought liberty to file some information 
---
 
4.3 
In reply to this, noticee has denied the allegations and submitted that it had neither 
indulged in any act which creates false or misleading appearance of trading in the 
securities market nor the said transactions were intended to operate as a device to 
inflate, depress or cause fluctuations in the price for wrongful gain or avoidance 
of loss. The noticee further submitted that the transactions were effected as per the 
---
4.9 
This pattern of trading can not be termed as mere co-incidence, it clearly signifies 
to some kind of pre-arrangement between the brokers before trading in the scrip. 
In the instant matter it is apparent that relatives of the noticee were the clients and 
placing the orders. This clearly signifies to the fact that the trades of noticee have 

Page 12 of 19 
---
led to increase in the volumes of the scrip. As the trades were entered solely for 
the purpose of generating artificial volumes in the scrip of Karuna which was not 
very actively traded. There was no genuine sale or purchase, no actual transfer of 
beneficial ownership in the scrip of Karuna on behalf of noticee and it appears 
that this was done to create an illusion in the mind of public that the scrip is 
highly liquid. 
 
---
stated, that such transactions un-doubtly create artificial market to mislead the 
genuine investors. Synchronized trading is violative of all the prudential and 
transparent norms of trading in the securities. Synchronized trading on a large 
scale can create false volumes, as happened in the instant case.  
 
4.11 
It is stated here that in case an entity is alleged to have distorted the market

4.14 
Before deciding on the issue the reliance may be placed on the observations of 
Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'SAT') in the 
matter of Ketan Parekh Vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 2 of 2004),  that ‘synchronization’

I also note that the Hon’ble SAT in Chirag Pujara Vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 175 of

by itself a serious violation of the Regulations which jeopardizes the integrity of 
the market. The trade data tabulated in enquiry report would show that the noticee

has matched and synchronized trades with M Bhiwaniwala & Co, Ashok Kumar

also place reliance on the observations of the Hon’ble SAT made in the matter of

game plan.”   
 
4.17 
The Hon’ble SAT, in Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. Ltd. Vs SEBI (Appeal no.54-
57/2001), observed as under:  
“BEB has been charged for synchronized deals with First Global. I 
have examined the data provided by the parties on this issue.  I find 
---
any entities controlled by the client is simultaneously entering any 
contra order elsewhere for the reason that in the online trading 
system, confidentiality of counter parties is ensured, is untenable. 
It was submitted by the Appellants that it was not possible for the 
broker to know who the counter party broker is and that trades 
were not synchronized but it was only a coincidence in some cases. 
Theoretically this is OK. But when parties decide to synchronize 
---
It may be stated that the synchronized trades/ cross deals/ circular trades are the 
instruments/ tools employed by some unscrupulous elements in the securities 
market to manipulate the market and deceive the general/ genuine investors in the 
market place. The pattern of trading, behaviour of the entities, apparent 
irregularities and the available trading data, etc., prove manipulation which 
always depends on inferences drawn on factual details. When all of these are 
considered together, they can emerge as ingredients to prove the manipulative 
---
way.  
 
4.21 
Thus, I find that the noticee by its acts has created false or misleading appearance 
of trading in the shares of Karuna along with the other brokers and clients, which 
were responsible for the market manipulation in the price of the scrip and thus 
violated Regulation 4 (1), 4 (2) (a), (b) and (g) of PFUTP Regulation. Further, by 
---
4.24 
The shares of Karuna were not very frequently traded in the market. Thus, the 
shares of Karuna which are left in the hands of the gullible investors who got 
trapped in the aforesaid sinister game plan, are nothing but junk shares. The 
genuine investors who had bought these shares have no exit route today. The 
investors had to suffer substantial amount of loss on account of the manipulation. 
Though it may not be possible to ascertain the exact quantum of monetary loss to "

4.0 
Consideration of Issues and Findings 
4.1 
---
From the Table A above and from the submissions of the noticee, it is seen that 
the client of the noticee i.e. Sh. Haresh Posnak has significantly contributed to the 
volumes generated in the scrip of Karuna. However, it is observed from the 
investigation report that no apparent connection between the client and 
counterparty broker/ clients have been brought out. Further the investigations do 
not find a nexus between the noticee and the counter party broker.  
 
---
 
4.6 
It has been noted that the broker in its reply has submitted that it was working on 
the instructions from its client in the subject scrip. No apparent nexus between the 
counter party clients and the noticee is visible from the findings of investigations 
in this case.  
 
---
4.7 
Considering the above factors and the submissions of the noticee, and on the basis 
of the evidence available on record it cannot be concluded that the noticee acted 
in a fraudulent manner and created artificial and misleading appearance of trading 
in the scrip.

that the said information is ‘stale’.  Such practice of furnishing

not be encouraged as otherwise this may snowball into an appalling

The furnishing of the information as sought through the summonses

to be compliance of the summonses issued by the IA. Further, I find

such transactions un-doubtly create artificial market to mislead the genuine 
investors. Synchronized trading is violative of all the prudential and transparent 
norms of trading in the securities. Synchronized trading on a large scale can create 
false volumes, as happened in the instant case.

It is worth considering the fact that in the relevant period of time noticee had

4.11 
The argument of noticee that in screen based trading the identity of the 
counterparty broker is not known at the time of the order input as the trading 
system is anonymous, do not appear to be a good defence as in the present 
circumstances, the pattern of trading clearly points out that the transactions were 
carried out with the sole intention that the orders of particular clients and brokers 
match with each other. Such matching of trades again and again over a period of

Before deciding on the issue the reliance may be placed on the observations of

registration with SEBI. I have noted that M/s VSE Stock Services Ltd. is a 
subsidiary of Vadodara Stock Exchange. In the present scenario when no trading 
is taking place at Vadodara Stock Exchange the brokers of this exchange are 
trading through the subsidiary of Vadodara Stock Exchange, in a capacity as sub-
broker of the subsidiary, which is the broker of Bombay Stock Exchange.  
 
4.5 
---
From the Table A above and from the submissions of the noticee, it is seen that 
the client of the noticee i.e. Sh. Mehul Shah has significantly contibuted to the 
volumes generated in the scrip of Karuna. However, it is observed from the 
investigation report that no apparent connection between the client and 
counterparty broker/ clients have been brought out. Further the investigations do 
not find a nexus between the noticee and the counter party broker.  
 
---
 
4.7 
It has been noted that the broker in its reply has submitted that it was working on 
the instructions from its client in the subject scrip. No apparent nexus between the 
counter party clients and the noticee is visible from the findings of investigations 
in this case.  
 
---
4.8 
Considering the above factors and the submissions of the noticee, and on the basis 
of the evidence available on record it cannot be concluded that the noticee acted 
in a fraudulent manner and created artificial and misleading appearance of trading 
in the scrip.

supporting documents, stating that the FII-TCW Galileo Funds, Inc. 
changed its name  to TCW Funds, Inc. on December 13, 2005. It was

In response to the SCN, the FII vide undated letter, received by SEBI on 
July 26, 2008, submitted that the FII was and is a non-investing FII with no 
purchase or sales of securities or holding in any of the sub-accounts. In 
December of 2005, TCW Galileo Funds, Inc. became TCW Funds, Inc. In 
February of 2006, State Street Bank & Trust, Custodian & Administrator 
was notified of the name change and asked to assist the FII in effecting 
name change in all of its open accounts around the world. The FII further

name change. Further, I am of the opinion that the name change is a 
material change in the information previously furnished to the SEBI and it 
has a bearing on the certificate granted by the SEBI to the FII. The said 
information is material because like a company, TCW Galileo Funds, Inc. 
is also a creation of law and has a legal personality. A legal entity is 
identified with its name and in the present case the very identity of the FII 
got changed when the said name change took place.

evident from the submission made by the FII that name change 
notification was made only as it decided to close its sub-account. If this

FACTS OF THE CASE IN BRIEF

Section 15 A (a) of the SEBI Act. In this regard it is pertinent to 
note that Section 11 C(2) of the SEBI Act empowers the 
investigating authority of SEBI to require a manager, managing 
director, officer and other employee of a company and every 
intermediary or any person associated with the securities market 
to furnish such information or to preserve and produce all the 
books, registers, other documents and record of the company or

director, officer and other employee of a company and every 
intermediary or any person associated with the securities market 
to furnish such information or to preserve and produce all the 
books, registers, other documents and record of the company or 
the intermediary, as may be required by the investigating 
authority. Further, Section 11 C(5) empowers the investigating 
authority to examine such persons. Timely submission of

March 9, 2006 to the noticee seeking certain important 
information in relation to the investigation. The queries 
contained in the said summons related to relationship of the 
Noticee with company SYPCL and his trading in the said scrip 
along with the details of the off market transfers in the said scrip. 
12. The noticee was required to furnish the said details by March 9, 
2006. It appears from the records that there is no proof of

during the period June 2004 and August 2004. Thus, it can be 
presumed that the noticee was executing substantial trades in 
this scrip. It is further stated that the noticee bought such a large 
number of shares of a company which has shown a dismal 
performance and is devoid of clean track record. It is in this 
context that the investigating authority of SEBI sought details of

23. It is noted from the details available on record that the noticee 
had executed substantial trades in the scrip. Further, the noticee 
is stated to have bought a large number of shares of a company 
which has shown a dismal performance and does not have a 
good track record. The failure on the part of the noticee in 
providing the information has to be viewed in this context. It is "

In reply to this, the noticee has submitted that it was not related with the client in 
any manner and the transactions were carried out by the client in the ordinary 
course of business and in his personal capacity. Further it has been submitted that 
the client was acting like a jobber with the noticee. The alleged transactions were 
solely for brokerage purposes and it had not created false or misleading market. 
No finance was extended for these transactions to the client. It has further stated 
---
From the Table A above and from the submissions of the noticee, it is seen that 
the client of the noticee i.e. Sh. Sunil Purohit has significantly contributed to the 
volumes generated in the scrip of Karuna. However, it is observed from the 
investigation report that no apparent connection between the client and 
counterparty broker/ clients have been brought out. Further the investigations do 
not find a nexus between the noticee and the counter party broker.

are the instruments/ tools employed by some unscrupulous elements in 
the securities market to manipulate the market and deceive the general/ 
genuine investors in the market place. The pattern of trading, behaviour 
of the entities, apparent irregularities and the available trading data,

factual details. When all of these are considered together, they can 
emerge as ingredients to prove the manipulative scheme designed and

persons can trade continuously for many days through synchronized 
orders in a number of trades contributing significantly to total volume 
in the market. Before deciding on the issue the reliance may be placed 
on the observations of Hon’ble Securities Appellate Tribunal 
(hereinafter referred to as 'SAT') in the matter of Ketan Parekh Vs. 
SEBI, that ‘synchronization’ or a 'negotiated deal' ipso facto is not 
illegal and that a synchronized transaction will, however, be illegal or 
---
get induced to deal in securities. In order to protect the interest of investors in 
the securities market, this type of activity should be curved and dealt firmly.  
17. 
The SAT in its earlier ruling in the order dated May 04, 2001 in the appeal No. 
36 of 2000 in the matter of Yogi Sungwon (India) Ltd. vs SEBI, also ruled that 
the AO has to satisfy himself about the severity of the violation before imposing 
penalty.  The relevant portion of this order is as follows:  
---
18. 
Taking a clue from the guidelines laid down by SAT, I am fully satisfied that 
this case deserves penalty. Therefore, in the circumstances and given the serious 
nature of the violation involved in the matter, I find it appropriate to impose a 
deterrent penalty as prescribed under Section 15HA  of the Act on the noticee.

from Rs.4 as on July 16, 2003 to a high of Rs.47.50 on November 17, 
2003. The scrip registered a closing price of Rs.46.35 on November 17, 
2003. It was observed that volume of trade in the scrip witnessed 
significant rise from October 09, 2003 accompanied by a sharp rise in 
price of the scrip from Rs.15.69 to Rs.47.50 in 30 trading days. The said 
rise in the price of the scrip did not appear to be in sync with the financial 
performance of the company SCL.

During the course of the said investigation, it was observed that the

dated July 22, 2008 and February 27, 2009 submitted, inter alia, the 
following: 
 
¾ That the total volume in monetary terms of their company in 66 trading 
days was Rs.105.90 Crores. Against this, the total volume in the scrip 
of SCL was only Rs.2.96 Crores which was only 2.79% of their total 
volume. This formed very small and insignificant part of their total 
---
account after this period, it can be seen that on a majority of the days, 
they have been in debit and have been provided a temporary overdraft 
to make good their obligations. 
¾ That none of their companies’ shareholders, directors or employees 
had any past or present relation with SCL. 
¾ Regarding the trade time being within 10 seconds and trades being at 
incrementally higher prices, they believed that the trades were in the 
---
continued to bid at market prices or at higher prices thereby influencing 
the scrip. As they were only acting on specific instructions of their 
clients, the trades were executed. 
¾ As a broking company, numerous clients keep calling and asking them 
for prices of multiple scrips before executing trades during trading 
hours and hence it is not possible for them to analyze a clients 
intentions during dynamic situations. 
---
¾ They had no past or present relation with Action Financial Services 
Ltd. 
¾ It is possible for SEBI to ask for the call records from the telecom 
company, MTNL. As their telephone numbers have not changed, 
MTNL will be in a position to provide SEBI with the details that they 
had received the calls from the client and they had acted only on their 
behalf and as per their instructions. "
